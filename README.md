xkcdpwgen — Generating XKCD-style passwords
============================================

`xkcdpwgen` is a tiny Python package that generates [XKCD-style passphrases](https://xkcd.com/936/) and it needs exactly one pass on the dictionary file.
Just one pass! Isn't that awesome‽ So use it with _large_ files.


Dictionary
-----------

A dictionary is just a text file with words, one word per line.

Where to get one? First, try looking at `/usr/share/dict/words` on your machine. Then check other machines around you.
If that didn't work, then your last chance is [Google](https://www.google.com/). Well, there is also [this page](http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/).
